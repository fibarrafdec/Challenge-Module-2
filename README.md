# Professional Portfolio project 

## Description

### User Story

As a employer,
I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a 
good candidate for an open position.


### Acceptance Criteria

It's done when the portfolio is created as an accesible web page.
It's done when the portfolio presents the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
It's done when I click one od the links inthe navigation bar and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
It's done when I click on the link to the section about their work and the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. 
It's done when I am presented with the developer's first application and the image of that application is larger in size that the others.
It's done when I click on the images of the applications and I'm taken to that deployed application.
It's done when I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices and I am presented with a responsive layaout that adapts to my viewport.
